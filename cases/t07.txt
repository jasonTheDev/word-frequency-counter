The sun did not shine.
It was too wet to play.
So we sat in the house
all that cold, cold, wet day.

I sat there with sally.
We sat there, we two.
And i said, how i wish
we had something to do;

Too wet to go out
and too cold to play ball.
So we sat in the house.
we did nothing at all.

So all we could do was to
Sit,
   Sit,
      Sit,
         Sit.
And we did not like it.
not one little bit.
